## How Users Grant Permissions

### Multi-Tenant Setup
1. **No Admin Pre-approval Required**: Users can grant permissions on first login
2. **User Consent**: Each user consents to permissions when they first access the integration
3. **Organizational Flexibility**: Works across different organizations without IT setup
4. **Secure by Design**: Uses Microsoft's OAuth2 security standards

### Permission Flow
1. User clicks "Connect to Microsoft" in ComplAI
2. Redirected to Microsoft's secure login page
3. User signs in with their Microsoft account
4. Microsoft shows permission consent screen
5. User grants permissions for ComplAI to access their data
6. User is redirected back to ComplAI with access tokens
7. ComplAI can now interact with Microsoft services on the user's behalf

## Security & Privacy

### Data Access
- **User-Specific**: ComplAI only accesses data the authenticated user has access to
- **Delegated Permissions**: ComplAI acts on behalf of the user, not as a separate application
- **Scope Limited**: Only the minimum required permissions for functionality
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire regularly and must be refreshed

### Data Usage
- **Project Context**: Data is used only for project management and collaboration
- **No Data Storage**: ComplAI doesn't store Microsoft data beyond necessary caching
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged in Microsoft's audit systems
- **User Control**: Users can revoke permissions at any time in their Microsoft account

## Updated Setup Process

The setup wizard at `/setup-microsoft` now includes:

1. **Step 1**: Create Multi-Tenant Azure App
2. **Step 2**: Configure All Required Permissions (expanded list)
3. **Step 3**: Get Application Credentials  
4. **Step 4**: Test Complete Integration
